This repository is used to keep track of the weight I lift everyday and my progress. The name of the repository comes from the "skip leg day" meme and the general belief that strengthening leg muscles improves sexual performance. 俗话说得好: 健身不练腿, 迟早得阳痿.

Note that the weights are normalized, meaning if two arms/legs are involved a workout, its recorded weight is divided by 2.
